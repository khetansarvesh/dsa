# Template 1 : Traversal / Searching

| Question | Iterative Solution (BFS) | Recursive Solution (DFS) (preferred) |
|:--------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|
| Traversal / Searching | BFS (uses queues) | DFS (uses stacks) |

Following questions are based on above template just that you need to make some changes

| Question | Iterative Solution (BFS) | Recursive Solution (DFS) (preferred) |

| Has path or not | [video](https://youtu.be/ZwGC60Ao6bQ?list=PL_z_8CaSLPWcn5bKG8UMI0St2D5EmQszx&t=1309) | [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwGC60Ao6bQ&list=PL_z_8CaSLPWcn5bKG8UMI0St2D5EmQszx&index=9) |
| Shortest path | BFS gives shortest path only | ❌ |
| Cycle detection | ❌ | [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPfUFoWjk5w) |
| Topological sort | N/A | N/A |

Now for a given question both interative approach or recursive appraoch is possible (as shown for few question above) but in most cases thinking about recursive approach is easy compared to iterative approach. Hence we should always try to solve using recursion.
