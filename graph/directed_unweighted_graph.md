Following questions are based on above template just that you need to make some changes

| Question | Iterative Solution (BFS) | Recursive Solution (DFS) |
|:--------:|:------------------------:|:------------------------:|
| Has path or not | N/A | N/A |
| Shortest path | N/A | N/A |
| Cycle detection | ❌ | [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLxfoaZlRqs) |
| Topological sort | [Kahn Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMiIk1B0v-w&list=PLUcsbZa0qzu1EhwPcQfbDfl9VitpSUgBp&index=8) | [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zbbe9FYVnM4&list=PLUcsbZa0qzu1EhwPcQfbDfl9VitpSUgBp&index=7) |

Now for a given question both interative approach or recursive appraoch is possible (as shown for few question above) but in most cases thinking about recursive approach is easy compared to iterative approach. Hence we should always try to solve using recursion.
