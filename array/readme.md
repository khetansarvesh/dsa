# Recursion

Use in those questions wherein we need to find all possible cases. Now in recurssion we know that we reduce into equivalent smaller subproblem. Now there are two ways to reduce a string into a smaller string : 
1. Reduce from end (preferred and most of the below solution are done using this)
2. Reduce from start (usually not preferred but sometimes is the only option and you cant reduce from the end, why? this is usually true in questions wherein forward information presented by a string is important for the question !!)


## $\color{red}{2.1\ Recursion}$

- <ins> 1 Recursive Tree </ins> : 
these questions are just for learning and ideally iterative approach is the preferred solution here. Hence you might not find here questions wherein you need to deal with all possible cases and so its okay if you dont think of solution such questions using recurssion.

here you will find questions wherein you need to deal with all possible cases hence you should think of recursion to solve it.

Note that all the above recursive algorithm can be improved using [Dynamic Programming (DP)]() where there are overlapping subproblems !!
