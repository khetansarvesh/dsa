Use in those questions wherein we need to find all possible cases.

- <ins> 1 Recursive Tree </ins> : 
these questions are just for learning and ideally iterative approach is the preferred solution here. Hence you might not find here questions wherein you need to deal with all possible cases and so its okay if you dont think of solving such questions using recurssion.

- <ins> 2 Recursive Tree </ins> : 
here you will find questions wherein you need to deal with all possible cases hence you should think of recursion to solve it.

Now in all the above problem we broke a bigger problem into a smaller problem (top-down approach) and solved it using recurssion. But there is this special 'rare' problem (Tower Of Hanoi) wherein we go from a smaller problem to a larger problem (bottom - up approach).

Note that all the above recursive algorithm can be improved using [Dynamic Programming (DP)]() where there are overlapping subproblems !!
